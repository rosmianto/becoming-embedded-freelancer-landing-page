I'm Rosmianto, an embedded systems engineer who used to be stuck with a fragile single stream of income.</p><p>Let me first ask you a question: what is the most generic way to make more money as an embedded engineer? Two: <em>promotion</em> or <em>switching company</em>.</p><p>But promotion isn't straighforward, you can't work twice as hard and expect to be promoted next year. That's not how it works. Promotion is also subject to <em><strong>execs' approval</strong></em>, subject to <em><strong>company financial</strong></em> and <em><strong>political situation</strong></em>. Hell, it's even subject to <em><strong>competition from your peers</strong></em> (they also want to be promoted right?).</p><p>Even when you get promoted, how much salary hike you'll get?</p><p>Not even 10% (mine was worse at 5%). That's excluding yearly inflation (around 3% in my country).</p><p>All that for a inflated title and more pressure and stress at work? <strong>No thanks</strong>.</p><p>Fine, you might be tempted to switch company. Now, the question is: can you find a significantly better company than yours currently? And can you actually pass their bar?</p><p>Why significantly better? Because, trust me, in many cases, switching company is just trading off one thing with another. Take my case for example, I was working at this company: paid good enough, work from home, close from my house, good friends, no politics.</p><p>If I want to make more money by switching company, that means I have to find another company with the good things above, plus with better pay. And let me tell you, it's hard. And not straightforward. Most times I need to sacrifice 3 things just to get 1 thing (better pay).</p><p>Also, no thanks.</p><p>I have tried promotion and switching stuff, and honestly those was only my <em>wants</em>, not my <em>needs</em>. What I truly need is just some income boosts.</p><p>Enter: <strong>freelancing world</strong>.</p><p>It's like getting paid by multiple bosses.</p><p> </p><p>I didn't come from money, I had to support myself in school, I have I crave for financial freedom</p><p>In this book, I want to guide you on how to be a freelancer as an embedded engineer. I will share with you my proven method of doing freelance. I will also share with you my framework you can steal.<br><br>This book isn’t a generic book, I don’t like reading long and tedious books, because they’re boring.<br><br>So in this book, I try my hardest to pack all the value I can share into this book, as compact as possible, without much fluffs and introduction bullshit.<br><br>In other words, I designed this book precisely to be to-the-point, zero bullshit, meat-only content, so you can extract my knowledge in this book as fast as possible. And thus, make money as a freelancer as soon as possible.</p><p><br>Ready?</p></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__left"><div class="footer__copy">Powered by Publii</div></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://freelancer.rosmianto.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = { mobileMenuMode: 'sidebar', animationSpeed: 300, submenuWidth: 'auto', doubleClickTime: 500, mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus: true, relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector: '.navbar', };</script><script defer="defer" src="https://freelancer.rosmianto.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=6450cfc483efd7e58ed8ad5b64050d3e"></script><script>function publiiDetectLoadedImages () {
