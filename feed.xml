<h3 class="align-center">"I want to be a freelancer working on embedded projects, but I don't know how."</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Rosmianto, an embedded systems engineer who used to be stuck with a fragile single stream of income.</p>
<p>Let me first ask you a question: what is the most generic way to make more money as an embedded engineer? Two: <em>promotion</em> or <em>switching company</em>.</p>
<p>But promotion isn't straighforward, you can't work twice as hard and expect to be promoted next year. That's not how it works. Promotion is also subject to <em><strong>execs' approval</strong></em>, subject to <em><strong>company financial</strong></em> and <em><strong>political situation</strong></em>. Hell, it's even subject to <em><strong>competition from your peers</strong></em> (they also want to be promoted right?).</p>
<p>Even when you get promoted, how much salary hike you'll get?</p>
<p>Not even 10% (mine was worse at 5%). That's excluding yearly inflation (around 3% in my country).</p>
<p>All that for an inflated title and more pressure and stress at work? <strong>No thanks</strong>.</p>
<p>Fine, you might be tempted to switch company. Now, the question is: can you find a significantly better company than yours? And can you actually pass their bar?</p>
<p>Why significantly better? Because, trust me, in many cases, switching company is just trading off one thing with another. Take my case for example, I was working at this company: paid good enough, work from home, close from my house, good friends, no politics.</p>
<p>If I want to make more money by switching company, that means I have to find another company with the good things above, plus with better pay. And let me tell you, it's hard. And not straightforward. Most of the times I need to sacrifice 3 things just to get 1 thing (better pay).</p>
<p>Also, no thanks.</p>
<p>I have tried promotion and switching stuff, and honestly those was only my <em>wants</em>, not my¬†<em>needs</em>. What I truly need is just some income boosts.</p>
<p>Enter: <strong>freelancing world</strong>.</p>
<p>Let's say you have years of experience in corporate world doing embedded stuff, what if I told you that people around the world are <strong>willing to pay you money</strong> to give them result exactly like you did at work?</p>
<p>It's like getting paid by multiple bosses to do the same thing.</p>
<p>Your firmware design skills at work? Someone from Korea wants that.</p>
<p>Or maybe you have skill to debug CAN bus system? Someone from Germany is desperate to find you, ready to spend $500 to save weeks of unnecessary troubleshooting sessions.</p>
<p>I knew that's interesting, that's why I tried freelancing from Upwork (for a $12.5 task) to LinkedIn (for $2950 per project). I have to admit that the journey wasn't easy, mostly because I had to figure it out from zero. I've spent too many time doing trial &amp; error since 2019.</p>
<p>As I grow my freelance business, I quickly realized that we need more and more freelancers especially in embedded systems industry. Why? Wouldn't that increase my competition?</p>
<p>Well, that's because my focus is low-power design and firmware development. And the clients wants more freelancers who know:</p>
<ul>
<li>Medical embedded systems</li>
<li>Automotive (CAN, LIN, Hard real-time RTOS)</li>
<li>Regulation and standards</li>
<li>Industrial IoT</li>
<li>How to write firmware for European Space Agency rocket payload (yes, someone asked me that).</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>I simply didn't have time and energy and expertise to cater all of them.</p>
<p>That's why I decided to put together what I know about freelancing, the path, the caveats, how to get clients. So you can try freelancing and handle those clients. Do you know this proverb?</p>
<p class="entry-title"><em>Give a Man a Fish, and You Feed Him for a Day. Teach a Man To Fish, and You Feed Him for a Lifetime.</em></p>
<p>What I want is to "Teach a Man to Fish". Simple as that.</p>
<h2>What I've put together</h2>
<p>When I first started working on this project, my goal was pretty simple: take all of my freelancing content on LinkedIn, bundle them up into one resource, and put it out into the world.</p>
<p>But as I work on this book, I added more and more material, it become more than just a book, but more like <strong>a complete starter kit for any embedded engineers to start freelancing</strong>.¬†</p>
<p>Here's what I ended up with...</p>
<h2>The Book üìñ</h2>
<p>A compact PDF containing frameworks, tips and tricks, and my freelance stories.</p>
<p>I deliberately designed this book to be short, because I want you to quickly finish the book and start implementing what's inside.</p>
<p>It's just 80-ish page book, so I estimate you can finish it in a day. And start implementing tomorrow.</p>
<p>I write the chapters to be as independent as possible, so you can read them in any order. And can be re-read as a reference.</p>
<p>[insert two pages with drop shadows]</p>
<h2>Proposal &amp; Contract Template üìú</h2>
<p>The book will teach you a ton, but there are some things best learned by seeing how an actual freelancer do it himself.</p>
<p>[insert to pages with drop shadows]</p>
<h2>Development Timetracker Template ‚è∞</h2>
<p>Do you think you need fancy software to manage development task list? This template will prove you otherwise. This is an actual spreadsheet I made to track one of my freelance project tasks (complete with the unmodified timestamp).</p>
<p>[insert the excel screenshot with drop shadows]</p>
<h2>Progress Update Email Template üì®</h2>
<p>See how I handled client via email. Weekly progress update email is my way of keeping my progress transparent.</p>
<p>[insert weekly email screenshot with drop shadows]</p>
<h2>Project Cost Breakdown Example üíµ</h2>
<p>See how I price a freelance project, down to each task, each time taken, each charged price, to total development cost.</p>
